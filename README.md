1. Header: comes standard (defautl) with a display block and occupies 100% of the screen width. So when we define 'position: fixed' it will lose
the width context and will adapt according to the width of the content that is inside the element, that is, we will need to define
again the width of the element.
2. The 'position: fixed' fixes the element on the screen taking into account the browser and creates a new context for the element. Therefore,
the element will be fixed on the local screen, freezing the element while scrolling the screen.
